## Async JS example
This project is an illustration of how a frontend can asynchronously fetch data from a backend.

The backend uses flask to serve the HTML as well as the data for the fetch API, but the frontend technologies used are backend-agnostic.
No real database was harmed during the process of making this project - the `userrepository.py` file contains an example of how to generate such test data.
